Well hello. This is the first project that I have started from scratch. Ive done many school projects before but never tried to start one on my own.

I am trying to create a google extension that can download instagram posts from a given profile.
I chose this idea because I didn't want to build a calculator or weather forecast because I saw alot of people building those. I haven't seen many people build a google extension before.
This is also out of my comfort zone because I have never learned this. I am applying my knowledge from everything else to try and adapt and overcome challenges. Its working quite well.
I am utilizing project-based learning to expand my skill sets across this field. 

If anyone has any ideas or tips please add on.
